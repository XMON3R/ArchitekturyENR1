```bash
cd /workspace
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v .:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite
```
Then open localhost:8080 in your browe and the documentation should occur.

All neded files for structurizer are stored in [workspace](/workspace/) folder and [features.md](/features.md) is the overview of features, but you can browse them easier via structurizr.
