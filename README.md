# Enrollment module

The enrollment module of the students information system is responsible for handling all the functionality connected with **enrollment** to subjects and **unenrollment** from them. 

### Documentation

You can run structurizr from workspace directory as a subdirectory in "initial ENR1 project": 

```bash
docker pull structurizr/lite
cd /workspace
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v .:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite
```
Then just open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and you can easily navigate across the documentation.

### Source files
All neded files for structurizer are stored in [workspace](/initial_ENR1project/workspace/) folder and [features.md](/initial_ENR1project/features.md) is the overview of features, but you can browse them easier via structurizr.

Older files with first design ideas of the module are located in [diagrams](/initial_ENR1project/diagrams/) folder.
